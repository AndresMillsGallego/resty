# Resty

Project by:  Andres Mills Gallego

## Lab 26

![UML](./resty-uml.png)

This is the first part in a 4 part lab series which will build out the RESTy React application

To start things off we imported some [starter code]() into our new repo. 
From there we refactored the existing code to make all components functional components (with the exception of the app.js component)
Then we began to work with Sass to style our app.
